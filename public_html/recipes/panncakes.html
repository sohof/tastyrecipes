                <li>100g flour  </li>
                <li>2 eggs </li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups milk  </li>
                <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil for frying</li>
                <li>pinch of salt</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
       
        <ol class="directions">
            <li><p class="directions">
                    Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre 
                    and crack the eggs into the middle. Pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the 
                    centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, 
                    beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.
                </p></li>
            <li><p class="directions">
                    Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, 
                    pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter 
                    that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream.
                </p></li>
            <li><p class="directions">
                    Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, 
                    tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter 
                    into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the 
                    excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake 
                    should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.    
                </p></li>
            
            <li><p class="directions">
                    Hold the pan handle, ease a palette knife under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure 
                    the pancake is lying flat against the base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before 
                    turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto 
                    a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.
